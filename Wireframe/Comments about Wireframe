Good design: 

Ikea
  Has clear category, easy to select the product by either name or picture

Ocean Health Index
  Top bar is clear to explain itself, navigation is smooth and not too much scroll

Bad design: 

Yelp: 
  category is at the bottom, too many pictures in the middle of the page, and no "go to top" button

foodpanda

No filter and category on the top, too many pictures without clear section, no "go to top" button
